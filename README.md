title: **The Blogger's code of ethics.

      The blogger's code of ethics was written by Tim O’Reilly and Jimmy Wales in response to controversy 
    surrounding blogger Kathy Sierra revieivng death threats.

  -Take responsibility not just for your own words, but for the comments you allow on your blog.
  -Label your tolerance level for abusive comments.
  -Consider eliminating anonymous comments.
  -Don't feed the trolls.
  -If you know someone who is behaving badly, tell them so.
  -Don't say anything online that you wouldn't say in person.

title: **The positives.**
There is some good insight in creating a “code” for people to follow or a guideline so they don't say anything offensive is a good idea. We live in a time where everyone gets mad or offended at anything anyone says and there is a lot of information that is in the “touchy subjects” section of conversation. Things that you just shouldn't talk about. Hate speech is a term that is thrown around alot and alot of sites where all they do is talk ill about a specific topic. Sites like these start arguments in the comments or on completely different sites all together. This happens because they get a following of fans or other people who agree with they opinions and starts spreading it on to other sites underneath comments. Which then starts bigger arguments which turn into threats and hate speech. So to the outside person when someone talks about a topic that gets a lot of hate comments or is to touchy of a topic (touchy being sensitive to talk about because it gets to many people angry or it can start up arguments and other actions)they assume its a hate video as well sometimes. Moderating comments is a good idea as well because there can be serious comments in the comment section that should be deleted. Like hate speech, threats, or other offensive comments that could hurt others or become more than just a friendly debate. So deleting some of these comments should be a must when it comes to being a blogger.

	There are some people who have actually drafted their own code of conduct. On what they believe the code should entail. Like tim o'reilly , who believes that bloggers as people should be responsible for their own words and what they say on their sites. As well as the comments they bring and the community of their blogs. Which is true because even if you don't welcome the comments since it is on your site, you are responsible for what goes on there. Hate speech and all.

title: **The negatives.**
The negative reaction expressed by bloggers around the world is as evident as the positive responses. The negativity has been triggered by questioning the compatibility of the codes itself with freedom of speech and expression. Jeff Jarvis, a professor, and director of interactive journalism at City College of New York commented that he would feel resentful of someone who would show the temerity to propose how one should behave. He further criticized the efficiency of the code in alleviating threatful comments by mentioning that miscreants will never sign to the code of conduct let alone adhere to it. People also attacked him saying this only curbs the freedom of expression among the bloggers, give propagators to spread lies and also venture capitals to profit from their foolish investments. Besides, this might turn out dangerous for the mass to be unable to express their rage against unjust laws and rules formulated by the state.
